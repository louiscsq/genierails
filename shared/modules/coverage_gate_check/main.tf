# Judges a coverage-gate result (envs/<env>/data_access/.coverage_gate.json,
# written by scripts/coverage_gate.py) for both the data_access layer (business
# SELECT) and the workspace layer (Genie CAN_RUN), so the two can't drift.
# Creates no resources.
#
# A result passes only if it records a pass for the expected fingerprint and a
# live refresh of tags and DDL (refreshed_at) no older than max_age at plan
# time. Terraform can't re-read Unity Catalog; this bounds how long a raw
# terraform run may rely on the last refresh. max_age is part of the
# data_access fingerprint, so changing it (-var, TF_VAR_) makes the result
# stale until the gate re-runs, and it can never exceed the ceiling below.
